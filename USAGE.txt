Internship Placement Management System
=====================================

Requirements
------------
- Java 17 or newer (uses standard library only)
- Windows PowerShell terminal (commands below use this shell)

Initial Data Files
------------------
The application reads and writes CSV files in the `data` folder that is created automatically on first launch.
- `sample_student_list.csv` and `sample_staff_list.csv` are used as the initial seed.
- `data/students.csv`, `data/staff.csv`, `data/company_reps.csv`, `data/internships.csv`, and `data/applications.csv` are created for persistent storage.
- Default password for every new account is `password` until changed by the user.

Build & Run
-----------
1. Open PowerShell in the project root (`c:\Users\LeeJR\Desktop\2002`).
2. Compile:
   `if (!(Test-Path out)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path out | Out-Null }; javac -d out src\ims\*.java`
3. Launch the CLI:
   `java -cp out ims.Main`

Usage Overview
--------------
- **Login** with your user ID and password. Students and staff use the IDs from the seed files. Company representatives register with their company email and await staff approval.
- **Change password** from within your role menu to override the default.

Student Capabilities
--------------------
- View internships that match your major, level eligibility, and active filters.
- Manage personal filters (status, major, level, closing date) which persist during the session.
- Apply to up to three internships (Year 1-2: Basic level only; Year 3-4: any level).
- Track applications, request withdrawals, and accept a successful offer (auto-withdraws other applications).

Company Representative Capabilities
-----------------------------------
- Register for approval by Career Center Staff.
- Create up to five internship listings (max 10 slots each). Submissions require staff approval before students can view/apply.
- Toggle internship visibility once approved, and review all applications.
- Approve or reject applications based on applicant information pulled from the student roster.

Career Center Staff Capabilities
--------------------------------
- Approve or reject company representative registrations.
- Approve or reject internship postings. Approved internships default to visible.
- Review student withdrawal requests (adjusts slots automatically if an accepted offer is withdrawn).
- Generate internship reports with optional filters (status, preferred major, level, closing date).

Data Persistence
----------------
- Every change immediately updates the relevant CSV file(s).
- If the CSV files already exist, they are loaded as-is; otherwise, the sample files seed the data.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set or `java`/`javac` commands are available in PowerShell.
- Delete the `data` folder to reset the system (the folder will be recreated from the sample lists on next run).
- If compilation fails, re-run the `javac` command and check the reported line numbers for syntax issues.
